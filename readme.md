# Portfolio

This portfolio includes code from small projects until final projects for graduate classes and my MBA in Data Science and Analytics.


## Data Science Projects

- [**Impact of macroeconomic indicators on electricity consumption**](impact_of_macroeconomic_indicators_on_electricity_consumption): This is the final project for my MBA course in Data Science and Analytics, taken at Universidade de São Paulo (USP) from May 2021 to December 2022. This project aims to investigate the impacts of macroeconomic indicators on Brazil's power consumption.
  
### Deep Learning Projects

- [**Bilingual models for better cross-lingual transfer**](./deep_learning_cross_lingual_transfer/): This is the final project for the post-graduation course class Introduction to Deep Learning in UNICAMP
  
- [Sentiment Analysis](./deep_learning_sentiment_analysis/): The project was part from a graduation class in the first semester of 2021. It is NLP neural net for sentiment analysis

## Misc. Projects

- [Solar Panels Study Case](./solar_panels_case_study/): A project to analyze when an investment in solar power would pay itself considering the inflation and the basic Tax rate of Brazil (SELIC) using statistical tools
- [Soccer Odds](./soccer_odds/): A project that calculates the soccer probabilities for next Brasilian games based on the aggregated odds from several betting houses.

## Automation Projects
- [Google Maps Automated Coordinates Search](./google_get_cities_coords/): This code searches the coordinates from a given list o addresses in google maps using selenium.
- [String Comparison](./string_comparison/): The project aimed to help find similar serial numbers in a bigger database – the output was intended to be analyzed by humans.

## Operational Research Projects
- [Time Slot Allocation](./time_slot_allocation/): Small project uses some optimization ideas to maximize the number of people that can attend a meeting. The project can be extended to other scheduling problems
